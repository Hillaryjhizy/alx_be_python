This repository contains Python scripts for various coding tasks covering fundamental concepts such as arithmetic operations, date/time handling with datetime module, shopping list management, and temperature conversions.
Scripts Overview
1. Arithmetic Operations (arithmetic_operations.py)
Description: Implements basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
How to Run: Modify the main() function with appropriate inputs and execute the script.
2. Shopping List Manager (shopping_list_manager.py)
Description: Allows users to add, remove, and view items in a shopping list using Python lists.
How to Run: Execute the script and follow the prompts to interact with the shopping list.
3. Explore datetime Module (explore_datetime.py)
Description: Demonstrates usage of the datetime module to display current date/time and calculate future dates.
How to Run: Run the script to see the current date/time and calculate a future date based on user input.
4. Temperature Conversion Tool (temp_conversion_tool.py)
Description: Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using global variables for conversion factors.
How to Run: Input a temperature and its unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) to see the converted temperature.
